Synopsis
--------

Add, update, and remove admins for a Hyperledger Fabric ordering service.

This module works with the IBM Support for Hyperledger Fabric software or the Hyperledger Fabric Open Source Stack running in a Red Hat OpenShift or Kubernetes cluster.






Parameters
----------

  api_endpoint (required)
    The URL for the Fabric operations console.

    | **Type**: str

  api_authtype (required)
    :literal:`basic` - Authenticate to the Fabric operations console using basic authentication. You must provide both a valid API key using :emphasis:`api\_key` and API secret using :emphasis:`api\_secret`.

    | **Type**: str

  api_key (required)
    The API key for the Fabric operations console.

    | **Type**: str

  api_secret
    The API secret for the Fabric operations console.

    Only required when :emphasis:`api\_authtype` is :literal:`basic`.

    | **Type**: str

  api_timeout
    The timeout, in seconds, to use when interacting with the Fabric operations console.

    | **Type**: int
    | **Default value**: ``60``

  state
    :literal:`absent` - An organization matching the specified name will be removed from the set of admins.

    :literal:`present` - Asserts that an organization matching the specified name and configuration exists in the set of admins. If no organization matches the specified name, the organization will be added to the set of admins. If an organization matches the specified name but the configuration does not match, then the organization in the set of admins will be updated.

    | **Type**: str
    | **Default value**: ``present``

  path (required)
    Path to current the system channel configuration file.

    This file can be fetched by using the :strong:`ERROR while parsing`\ : While parsing "M(channel\_config)" at index 39: Module name "channel\_config" is not a FQCN module.

    This file will be updated in place. You will need to keep a copy of the original file for computing the configuration update.

    | **Type**: str

  organization (required)
    The organization to add, update, or remove from the set of admins.

    You can pass a string, which is the display name of an organization registered with the Fabric operations console.

    You can also pass a dictionary, which must match the result format of one of the :strong:`ERROR while parsing`\ : While parsing "M(organization\_info)" at index 82: Module name "organization\_info" is not a FQCN or :strong:`ERROR while parsing`\ : While parsing "M(organization[])" at index 106: Module name "organization[]" is not a FQCN modules.

    | **Type**: raw

  policies
    The set of policies for the ordering service admin. The keys are the policy names, and the values are the policies.

    You can pass strings, which are paths to JSON files containing policies in the Hyperledger Fabric format (common.Policy).

    You can also pass a dict, which must correspond to a parsed policy in the Hyperledger Fabric format (common.Policy).

    Default policies are provided for the Admins, Writers and Readers policies. You only need to provide policies if you want to override these default policies, or add additional policies.

    | **Type**: dict
